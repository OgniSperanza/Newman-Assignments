                <h2>Artifact 1</h2>
                <p><b>Reflection</b>: Database Management Systems was the corner stone of my database related knowledge and skills. I choose this assignment as an
                    artifact because it was the first time I used several applications to produce an end product. The artifact attached illustrates this through
                    its contents, which are a Microsoft Access Database containing sample data related to walk-a-thon participants, a Microsoft Excel file used to 
                    organize the data as well as create a graphical representation, and finally a Microsoft Word document that executes a query on the database to 
                    automatically generate thank you letters for the walk-a-thon participants. 
                    <br />   
                    <br />      
                    All of these applications had to interact with one another in order for the information to be presented, analyzed and fully utilized by the end user. 
                    During this assignment I wore all the hats, however, in a 
                    business environment that may not be the case. There may be a business analyst writing and executing the queries, passing the 
                    results off to an accountant to organize and analyze for an upcoming meeting, and then given to a customer representative to prepare the
                    thank you letters. 
                    <br />
                    <br />    
                    Ultimately, once I realized how large of scope these interactions may have I finally saw a piece of the bigger picture and understood how
                    different software, interacts with data in a variety of ways, and aids in storing, organizing, analyzing data for business operations.

                <h2>Artifact 2</h2>
                <p><b>Reflection</b>: After DBMS I took Database Processing and Management, which solidified my learning experience from Database Management Systems. As
                   with the previous iteration of my database classes I choose an assignment that captured a broad spectrum of ways software models business 
                   applications and aids with decision making. In this assignment we had to construct a database from scratch for the Spartan Chemical Company and
                   and create all of the entry forms, entity relationships, and queries that would be used for Spartan Chemical's database. Moreover, the database
                   needed to be normalized and ensure that as much as possible the system was free from anomalies. 
                   <br />
                   <br />    
                   For the final version we split the database into a
                   front end and a back end. The front end remained in Microsoft Access, but the back end was set up for Microsoft SQL Server. This separation
                   allowed the forms for data entry and navigation stay on the easily accessible Microsoft Access front end and the data to be stored on the 
                   more secure and manageable SQL Server box. The project also involved a bit of VBscript and the integration of custom help files into the Access
                   database. 
                   <br />
                   <br />    
                   Overall, this project allow me to experience a database set up that more closely parallels an environment one would encounter in a 
                   production environment. Additionally, because this database was constructed from the down up, I was able to gain great insight into how a 
                   database must be constructed to model the daily business operations and conform to an individual organization's business rules.
